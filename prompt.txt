Analyze this screen recording with audio.

Follow the mouse cursor closely - track where it moves, what it hovers over, what it clicks, what the user is pointing at.

Extract:
1. **Screen** - What's visible (apps, text, code, errors)
2. **Mouse + Actions** - Where cursor goes, what user clicks/points at, in sequence
3. **Audio** - Transcript of what's said
4. **Intent** - What they need help with

Be specific. Output should give an AI full context to assist.
