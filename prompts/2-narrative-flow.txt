Watch this screen recording with audio and create a flowing narrative that captures both what's happening visually and what's being said.

Write as if you're describing the recording to someone who can't see it, weaving together:
- What appears on screen
- What actions the user takes
- What they say as they do it
- The sequence and flow of the workflow

Be specific about UI elements, text, and errors you see. Include the exact words spoken.

Format as a coherent narrative, not bullet points. Make it easy to understand the full context of what the user is showing and explaining.
