You are preparing context for another AI assistant. Watch this screen recording with audio and extract everything needed for that AI to understand and help.

Create a context brief that includes:

**What the user is working on:**
[Application/website, the task they're attempting]

**Current state:**
[What's visible on screen - be specific about code, errors, UI state]

**What they did:**
[Step-by-step actions taken during the recording]

**What they said:**
[Transcript of spoken narration - this reveals their intent and thinking]

**Likely intent:**
[Based on actions + narration, what does the user probably want help with?]

---

Write this so another AI reading it can immediately understand the situation and provide relevant assistance. Be specific about any error messages, code snippets, or technical details visible.
